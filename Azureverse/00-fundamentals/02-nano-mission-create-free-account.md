# Nano Mission: Create a Free Azure Account

Welcome to your first official mission in the **Azureverse**. Before you can automate, deploy, or accidentally spin up a
Virtual Machine that costs way too much â€” you'll need an Azure account.

Fear not. This mission is short, simple, and free.

## ðŸ›¸ Objective

Create a free Azure account so you can start exploring the cloud without spending your entire coffee budget.

## ðŸ§­ Steps

1. Go to the official portal: [https://azure.microsoft.com/free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free)
2. Click **Start free**
3. Sign in with a Microsoft account (or create one)
4. Fill in the details (card required, but you won't be charged for free services)
5. Confirm your identity, accept the terms, and activate your free trial

You now have:

- $200 in credits for 30 days
- Access to 55+ services that are always free
- A license to explore, experiment, and (safely) break things in the cloud

## âœ… Mission Complete

You're now cleared for launch. Time to build something awesome â€” or at least open the portal and pretend you know what
you're doing.
