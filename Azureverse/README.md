You're about to explore a galaxy of quick, focused learning experiences:

- **Briefings** – Concept explainers, either written or on video. Think of them as your pre-mission pep talk.
- **Missions** – Hands-on tasks to complete. One objective. One operation. Zero drama. Maximum clarity.
- **Incursions** – Bigger builds. Multiple services. Maximum snacks recommended.

No fluff. No hypersleep. Just tactical content designed to level up your Azure skills—one deploy at a time.
