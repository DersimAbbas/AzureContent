# Mission: Deploy a Web App from VS Code

Welcome back, Agent of the Azureverse. You've written the code ‚Äî now it's time to launch it into the cloud. In this
Mission, you'll deploy a basic web app directly from Visual Studio Code to Azure App Service.

## üõ∏ Objective

Use the VS Code extension to deploy a simple app to Azure App Service. You'll experience the thrill of deployment
without the horror of broken CI/CD pipelines.

## üß™ Prerequisites

- An Azure account (complete [this mission](../00-fundamentals/02-mission-create-free-account) if you haven't)
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) installed
- [Azure Tools extension pack](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.vscode-node-azure-pack)

## üöÄ Steps

1. Open your app folder in VS Code
2. Sign in to Azure via the extension (click the Azure icon in the sidebar)
3. Right-click your project folder and choose **Deploy to Web App**
4. Select or create a new App Service
5. Choose the appropriate runtime stack (Node, .NET, Python, etc.)
6. Confirm deployment and let Azure do the rest

‚ö†Ô∏è Note: On first deploy, VS Code might zip-punch your files into orbit. Be patient.

## ‚úÖ Mission Complete

Your app is now live on the internet ‚Äî possibly being indexed by bots and admired by aliens. Congratulations.
