# Cloud Bit: What Are Logic Apps?

Welcome to the **Azureverse** — where automation is the only intelligent lifeform.

In this Cloud Bit, we're beaming down the basics of **Logic Apps** — Azure’s way of helping you automate boring tasks so
you can focus on more important things... like naming your next resource group something other than "rg-final-final-v2".

## 🤖 What is a Logic App?

A Logic App is an automated workflow that lives in the cloud. It listens for events (like "It’s Monday 09:00 again") and
performs actions (like "Send an email because Future You will forget").

Think of it like your cloud-based assistant that never sleeps, never forgets, and definitely won't judge your folder
structure.

## 🚀 What can you do with it?

- Send emails on a schedule
- Connect to APIs
- Process data
- Trigger workflows when files are uploaded
- And basically automate the things you don’t want to do manually every week

## 📦 Key Components

- **Trigger** – What starts the flow (e.g., a timer, an event, or even a tweet)
- **Actions** – What happens next (e.g., send an email, call an API, post in Teams)
- **Connectors** – Built-in integrations with over 400 services (Outlook, GitHub, Twitter, etc.)

## 🌩️ Why should you care?

Because time is precious and automation is your new sidekick. Logic Apps let you build workflows without writing code,
and that's as close to wizardry as it gets in the cloud.
