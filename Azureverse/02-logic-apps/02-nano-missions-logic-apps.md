1. Trigger: Recurrence – every Monday at 09:00 hours.
2. Action: Send an email via Outlook containing a reminder of your choice (or a cryptic message from your time-traveling
   self).

2. Action: HTTP GET – call https://api.chucknorris.io/jokes/random.
3. Action: Send an email via Outlook containing the joke payload. Congratulations, you've built a comedy beacon.
