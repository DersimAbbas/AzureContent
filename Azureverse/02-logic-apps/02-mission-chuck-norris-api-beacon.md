# Mission 02: Chuck Norris API Beacon

## Objective:

Connect to a public API and inject some humor into your system. Every day, retrieve and transmit a random Chuck Norris
fact via email. Useless? Perhaps. Entertaining? Absolutely.

## Steps to deploy:

1. Trigger: Recurrence â€“ runs once daily (or whenever the AI wakes up).
2. Action: HTTP GET â€“ call https://api.chucknorris.io/jokes/random.
3. Action: Send an email via Outlook containing the joke payload. Congratulations, you've built a comedy beacon.
